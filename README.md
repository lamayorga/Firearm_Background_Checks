# Firearm Background Checks
## Investigating Firearm Background Checks Using FBI Gun Data
Firearm background check trends were analyzed using data retrieved from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) and US Census. This project focuses on going through the entire data analysis process from posing questions to sharing findings.

## Datasets
The FBI Gun data can be found in this [BuzzFeed News GitHub repository](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/nics-firearm-background-checks) and the US Census dataset can be found on the [census website](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/). Both datasets are included in this repo titled 'gun_data.xlsx' and 'census_data.csv' respectively. 

## Software
The following software was used to build this analysis: 
* Python and libraries:
  * Matplotlib 
  * NumPy
  * pandas
  * SciPy
  * Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebooks

## Summary of Findings/Explored Questions
Through the exploration of the U.S. Census and FBI Gun Datasets, the following insights were revealed:
> * The census data most associated with high background checks is 'Total Manufacturers' Shipment.'
* Firearm shopping has seasonality with background checks increasing in the winter and decreasing in the summer.
* The most frequently registered gun type is a long gun and is positively correlated with the total number of firearm checks.
* Kentucky has had the greatest number of firearm background checks since 1998.
